        "## What differentiates financial sector in using AI\n",
        "\n",
        "The challenges provided by an increasing adoption of AI are not exclusive to the financial sector. Still, from an AI-perspective finance differs from other industries in a number of important ways that warrant an adequate regulatory and supervisory response.\n",
        "\n",
        "One such difference is that ***the financial sector is commonly held to a higher societal standard*** than many other industries, as trust in financial\n",
        "institutions is considered essential for an effective financial system. Furthermore, many consumers regard financial institutions like banks, insurance\n",
        "companies, and pension funds ***to be providers of a utility function***. The data that these companies extract from their customers are therefore regarded as a by-product of this function, instead of a commercial asset for the financial sector to monetise. Even data usage that is acceptable from a strictly legalistic perspective can result in material reputational damage if it does not correspond to the expectations of society at large.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another aspect that makes finance special is ***the potential impact of AI on financial stability***. The financial system is not impervious to shocks. As\n",
        "experienced in the global financial crisis, problems can propagate through the system rapidly. When AI increasingly manages financial transactions, relatively small incidents could have major consequences. Given the increasing importance\n",
        "of tech giants in providing AI-related services and infrastructure, the concept of systemic importance may also need to be extended to include these companies at some point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the inherent interconnectivity of the financial system, ***the rise of AI has a strong international dimension***. An adequate policy response will require close international cooperation and clear minimum standards and guidelines for the sector to adhere to. Regulatory arbitrage in the area of AI could have dangerous consequences and should be prevented where possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finance can also be different from other industries as many financial services have ***a very specific data environment***. Because\n",
        "of cultural and legal differences data are, in many cases, only representative for domestic markets. Good examples of this are data pertaining to credit, pensions and mortgages. This may provide a challenge for the development of data-hungry AI systems, especially for relatively small markets as that of the Netherlands. Furthermore, because of ***continuous changes to the financial regulatory framework***, historic data quickly becomes less representative and unusable for training AI-enabled systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The progress of AI in beating humans in increasingly difficult games should also give us pause. In its design, the stock market is set up as a perfect\n",
        "information game, in which all participants have access to the same information.Banking and insurance can arguably be regarded as imperfect information games: customers have information regarding their financial position and risk profile\n",
        "that is unavailable to banks and insurance companies. AIs like AlphaGo and Liberatus are making huge strides in ***beating humans in both perfect and\n",
        "imperfect information games***. Now that computer performance is progressing to the point where it equals the raw performance capabilities of the human brain, we should consider the possibility that at some point – perhaps sooner than we think – AIs could surpass human agents in trading, banking and insurance as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the increasing importance of AI for the financial sector also invites us ***to rethink our traditional supervisory paradigms***. When it comes to AI, strong operational controls could be more important than capital and liquidity buffers. We will increasingly come across business models that are driven primarily by the monetization of data, rather than by product fees and interest margins."
